## A home-use Flask server for file transfer between multiple devices.
### Install the [dependencies](requirements.txt) and execute the [main file](run.py).

### Long Todo: Enable encryption of session cookies. Connect the Flask app to an Apache server for production use. Protect the server from abuse.
